## UntarJS

Library for reading tar files in the browser

-----

### Summary:

This library is a free [InvokIT/js-untar](https://github.com/InvokIT/js-untar) adaptation designed on ES6 syntax.

To use this requires additional library for inflating deflate binary blobs. The [pako inflate](https://github.com/nodeca/pako/blob/master/dist/pako_inflate.min.js) library is recommended, but you can use any similar library.

-----

### Brief history:

I needed to unzip in the browser some `.tgz` (tarball) files from modules published to [registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) in order to extract the raw from their files.

Unfortunately popular libraries were not very helpful in solving my "specific" problem.

[JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) didn't seem to solve it, [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) alone didn't help me much, so I found [js-untar](https://github.com/InvokIT/js-untar) and the story changed ðŸ˜€

-----

### Feature:

Tiny source ... untarjs-with-worker.min.js contains 4.1Kb (1.8Kb gzipped)

-----

### Use:

**Call pako in your document**

```html
<body>
  <script src="path/to/pako_inflate.min.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/your/script.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

**In your script module**
```javascript
// pako not suport ES6 module yet ... pako stay in `window` object
let pako = window.pako

/**
 * import untarjs (basic - expect `Worker` url param) or use `Worker` with `Blob` version
 * 'path/to/untarjs-with-worker.min.mjs'
 */
import untarjs from 'path/to/untarjs.min.mjs'

// request your `.tgz` file (get `ArrayBuffer`)
fetch('path/to/file.tgz').then(response => response.arrayBuffer()).then(async buffer => {

    // inflate
    const inflator = await pako.inflate(buffer)
    
    // get `Array` object(s) file(s) (wit `Worker` url param)
    let result = await untarjs(inflator.buffer, 'path/to/untar.worker.min.js')
    
    // show result (`Array`)
    console.log(result) // output: > [{...}]
    
}).catch(console.error)
```

This library returns a `Promise()`, in the example above was used `async/await` syntax to save writing.

A "conventional" example would be like this:

```javascript
fetch('path/to/file.tgz').then(response => response.arrayBuffer()).then(buffer => {

    // inflate
    const inflator = pako.inflate(buffer)
    
    // get `Array` object(s) file(s) (wit `Worker` url param)
    untarjs(inflator.buffer, 'path/to/untar.worker.min.js').then(result => {
    
        // show result (`Array`)
        console.log(result) // output: > [{...}]
        
    }).catch(console.error)
    
}).catch(console.error)
```

The result is an object (`Array`) containing a collection, you can iterate over them to get your raw data (`ArrayBuffer`) and use it however you like.


Given the following structure of a `.tgz` file (hypothetic):

```none
package/
    package.json
    README.md
    lib/
        index.js
```

The expected result would be (output on `console.log`):

```console
(3) [
    0: {
        buffer: ArrayBuffer(1936) {}
        checksum: 11547
        devmajor: 0
        devminor: 0
        gid: NaN
        gname: ""
        linkname: ""
        mode: "000644 "
        mtime: 499162500
        name: "package/package.json"
        namePrefix: ""
        size: 1936
        type: "0"
        uid: NaN
        uname: ""
        ustarFormat: "ustar"
        version: "00"
    }
    1: {
        buffer: ArrayBuffer(19335) {}
        checksum: 10553
        devmajor: 0
        devminor: 0
        gid: NaN
        gname: ""
        linkname: ""
        mode: "000644 "
        mtime: 499162500
        name: "package/README.md"
        namePrefix: ""
        size: 19335
        type: "0"
        uid: NaN
        uname: ""
        ustarFormat: "ustar"
        version: "00"
    }
    2: {
        buffer: ArrayBuffer(41328) {}
        checksum: 11477
        devmajor: 0
        devminor: 0
        gid: NaN
        gname: ""
        linkname: ""
        mode: "000644 "
        mtime: 499162500
        name: "package/lib/index.js"
        namePrefix: ""
        size: 41328
        type: "0"
        uid: NaN
        uname: ""
        ustarFormat: "ustar"
        version: "00"
    }
    length: 3
    __proto__: Array(0)
]
```

Where perhaps (matter of opinion) the relevant data of each object is:

* **buffer**: the raw data of file (`ArrayBuffer`)
* **name**: the full pathname of file (`String`)
* **size**: the file size in bytes (`Number`)

With this information we already have enough to do something ðŸ¤”

-----


### Use cases:

With this raw data it would be possible to create blobs (`Blob`) to store in cache (`Cache`) them in response to requests (if using a `ServiceWorker`), store them in `IndexedDB` or whatever else you can imagine.

Enjoy

-----

### Notes:

> Adapted pako_inflate.js 1.0.10 to ES6 module: [pako_inflate.min.mjs](https://gist.github.com/subversivo58/59433c016b06f17f20545fb8cc7f88b3)

Methods `.blob()`, `.getBlob()`, `.readAsString()` and `.readAsJSON()` from the original library ([js-untar](https://github.com/InvokIT/js-untar)) were removed in this adaptation.

You must implement your own logic to manipulate the file buffer for desired output.
